# SQL-Python-Tableau-AutoAnalysis

Project Title: Business Insights and Data Analysis for a Global Automotive Company

Overview: In this project, I worked as a Business Consultant, leveraging SQL for data extraction, Python for regression analysis, and Tableau for data visualisation. The project involved extracting valuable business insights from a complex database, performing regression analysis, and creating various visualisations to inform strategic business decisions.

Key Responsibilities:
1.	Data Extraction and Visualization:
  - Extracted valuable business information from the database using SQL, employing various data manipulation clauses such as JOINS, WHERE, BETWEEN, and LIKE.
  - Created at least three descriptive visualizations using Tableau to represent the extracted data, providing clear insights into business performance and trends.
2.	Employee Distribution Analysis:
  - Queried the total number of employees and created a Tableau visualization to display staff distribution across different countries.
  - The visualization highlighted regional staffing levels, aiding in resource allocation and workforce planning.
3.	Linear Regression Analysis (Python):
  - Identified two appropriate variables from different tables and performed a linear regression analysis using Python to explore possible relationships between them.
  - Visualized the regression results and explained the outcomes, providing insights into the correlations and their potential business implications.
4.	Product Stock Visualization:
  - Used Tableau to visualize the stock availability per line of products, offering a clear overview of inventory levels across the companyâ€™s product range.
  - This visualization supported inventory management and decision-making regarding stock replenishment.
5.	Order Status Visualization:
  - Created a visualization to display the current order status, giving a real-time snapshot of orders in progress, completed, or delayed.
  - This visualization was instrumental in monitoring operational efficiency and identifying bottlenecks in the order fulfillment process.
6.	Nationality-Based Purchase Analysis:
  - Analyzed the nationalities of customers purchasing cars in different offices, using Tableau to visualize the proportion of nationalities in each showroom.
  - This analysis provided insights into customer demographics and regional market preferences.
